## Resource Integration Process

### 1. Resource Analysis

Analyze the provided resource and determine:

- Resource type (paper, course, video, book, blog)
- Key topics covered
- Difficulty level and prerequisites
- Quality and credibility assessment
- Time investment required

### 2. Roadmap Integration

Review @MASTER_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md and suggest:

- Which cluster(s) this resource should be added to
- Priority level: Primary/Supplementary/Optional
- Whether it replaces existing resources
- If it suggests creating a new cluster

### 3. Update Living Resources

Add to @LIVING_RESOURCES.md with:

- Current timestamp
- Complete resource metadata
- Integration recommendations
- Cross-references to relevant clusters

### 4. Sprint Impact Assessment

Check @SPRINT_PLANNER.md for:

- Impact on current sprint materials
- Session timeline adjustments needed
- Blog scope modifications
- Resource priority in active sessions

### 5. Learning Path Optimization

- Assess fit with overall learning progression
- Identify prerequisites or follow-up resources
- Recommend optimal learning sequence
- Note any knowledge gaps this fills

Provide specific integration plan with updated roadmap sections and priority recommendations.
