## Sprint Planning Process

### 1. Progress Assessment

Check @MASTER_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md for:

- Current completion status (clusters completed)
- Next phase to focus on
- Any clusters needing review

### 2. Sprint Structure Design

For $ARGUMENTS duration:

- Determine target clusters (typically 4 for 2-week, 2 for 1-week)
- Plan session schedule (2 sessions per week)
- Set blog publication targets

### 3. Session Planning

For each target cluster:

- Extract materials from @MASTER_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md
- Create 2.5-hour session breakdown
- Set success criteria and Knowledge Forge focus
- Plan blog scope and timeline

### 4. Update Sprint Planner

Modify @SPRINT_PLANNER.md with:

- New sprint dates and focus
- Detailed session plans
- Blog pipeline schedule
- Resource lists with verified links
- Progress tracking structure

### 5. Integration Check

- Ensure logical learning progression
- Verify prerequisite coverage
- Check time allocation realism
- Plan sprint adjustment triggers

Provide complete sprint ready for launch with all materials, timelines, and success criteria defined.
