## Sprint Adjustment Actions:

### For "behind" - Sprint is running late:

- Extend sprint timeline by 3-4 days
- Simplify session content or reduce supplementary materials
- Focus on core concepts only
- Update session timing and expectations

### For "ahead" - Sprint is progressing faster than expected:

- Add depth to existing sessions (more advanced materials)
- Start next sprint early with overlap
- Add implementation exercises or experiments
- Include additional blog posts

### For "new-priority" - Urgent new learning need emerged:

- Insert micro-sprint for priority topic
- Reorganize current session order
- Add new resources to current sprint
- Adjust blog pipeline accordingly

### For "time-constraint" - Less time available than planned:

- Reduce session length from 2.5 to 2 hours
- Focus on essential materials only
- Defer supplementary resources
- Simplify blog requirements

## Required Updates:

1. Update session schedules and timelines in @SPRINT_PLANNER.md
2. Modify resource lists and time allocations
3. Adjust blog pipeline and expectations
4. Update success criteria if needed
5. Note changes in sprint notes section
6. Provide clear next steps for adjusted sprint
