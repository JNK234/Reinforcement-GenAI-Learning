## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

**Risk**: NotebookLM prompt limitations affecting depth of learning
**Mitigation**: Extensive prompt testing and optimization, fallback to alternative AI tools if needed

**Risk**: Cluster sizing mismatch leading to overwhelming or insufficient blog content
**Mitigation**: Dynamic cluster adjustment based on actual session outcomes, buffer content strategy

**Risk**: Sprint rigidity conflicting with natural learning pace
**Mitigation**: Built-in adjustment mechanisms (`/sprint-adjust`), flexible scheduling options

### Medium-Risk Areas

**Risk**: Resource integration disrupting established learning flow
**Mitigation**: Structured evaluation process, integration planning, user decision points

**Risk**: System complexity overwhelming the learning focus
**Mitigation**: Command simplification, clear documentation, progressive feature introduction

**Risk**: Motivation decline due to rigid structure
**Mitigation**: Regular milestone celebrations, flexible content choices, progress visualization
