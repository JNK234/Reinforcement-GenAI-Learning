## Sprint Management

### Weekly Check-in Questions:
- [ ] Are we on track for 2 sessions this week?
- [ ] Any clusters need more time or seem too easy?
- [ ] Blog pipeline flowing smoothly?
- [ ] Any new resources to integrate?

### Sprint Adjustment Triggers:
- **Behind Schedule**: Extend sprint by 3-4 days
- **Ahead of Schedule**: Add depth/experiments or start next sprint early  
- **New Urgent Resource**: Micro-sprint insertion
