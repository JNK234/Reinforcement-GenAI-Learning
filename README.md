# RL & GenAI Learning System
*Structured Learning Journey for Reinforcement Learning & Generative AI*

## Quick Start

1. **Check Progress**: `progress` - View your learning dashboard
2. **Plan Sprint**: `plan-sprint 2-week` - Set up your next learning cycle  
3. **Prepare Session**: `session-prep 1.1` - Get ready for cluster 1.1
4. **Complete Session**: `session-complete 1.1 high` - Finish with confidence level
5. **Check Blog Readiness**: `blog-ready 1.1` - See if ready to write

## Essential Documents

### 📚 **MASTER_LEARNING_ROADMAP.md**
Your complete 24-cluster curriculum across 7 phases. Track progress and find what to learn next.

### 🗓️ **SPRINT_PLANNER.md** 
2-week focused learning schedules. Contains session plans, materials, and success criteria.

### 📖 **LIVING_RESOURCES.md**
Dynamic collection of learning materials. Add new resources as you discover them.

### 📊 **logs/** 
Session logs and learning reflections. Document your journey and insights.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Structured Progression**: 24 carefully sequenced learning clusters
- **Sprint-Based**: 2-week cycles with 4 focused sessions each
- **Active Learning**: NotebookLM Knowledge Forge methodology
- **Content Creation**: Blog post per completed cluster
- **Progress Tracking**: Confidence levels and completion status

## Current Status

- **Phase**: RL Foundations (Clusters 1.1-1.4)
- **Progress**: 0/24 clusters completed
- **Target**: 2 blogs per week, systematic progression
